CWAC StrictModeEx: Punishment for the Bad Code In Your App
==========================================================

`StrictMode` is a handy feature in API Level 9 and higher,
telling you where your Android application is doing things
it probably should not on the main application thread.

In the spirit of `StrictMode`, the `StrictModeEx` project
offers classes to help you diagnose similar sorts of problems
beyond what `StrictMode` itself offers.

Right now, that consists of one class: `StrictAdapter`. This
`ListAdapter` wrapper will log slow-running `getView()` calls,
plus optionally give you an overall performance view on how
your `Adapter` is doing in the code you control.

This is [available as a JAR file](https://github.com/commonsguy/downloads).
The project itself is set up as an Android
library project, in case you wish to use the source code in
that fashion.

Usage: StrictAdapter
--------------------
Normally, you create your own `ListAdapter` (e.g., an `ArrayAdapter`)
and give that to your `AdapterView` (e.g., `setListAdapter()` on a
`ListFragment`).

Now, you create your own `ListAdapter`, wrap it in a `StrictAdapter`,
and put the `StrictAdapter` in the `AdapterView`. To do this, just
use the `StrictAdapter` constructor, which takes your regular
`ListAdapter` as a parameter.

By default, the `StrictAdapter` will log all calls to `getView()`
that take longer than 1ms (1000000ns). You can alter this by
calling `setThreshold()`, which takes the desired threshold
time in nanoseconds.

Any `getView()` call that takes longer than the threshold is logged
with error severity to LogCat. By default, the tag will be `StrictAdapter`,
though you can change this via a call to `setLogTag()`.

If you want, you can dump the overall performance metrics to LogCat
(debug severity) via a call to `dumpResultsToLog()`. This will report
the total number of `getView()` calls, the number that were penalized
(i.e., exceeded the threshold), the total time across all the calls,
and the mean time per call. A call to `reset()` clears the statistics.

Even on production hardware with a trivial `ListAdapter` (such as the
one in the `demo/` sub-project), you *will* find `getView()` calls that
exceed the default 1ms threshold. It should only be a few percent of
the total number of calls, and it could easily represent background
work from other processes that happened to steal a time slice while
your `getView()` was running.

Dependencies
------------
This project relies upon the [CWAC AdapterWrapper](https://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-adapter) project.
A copy of compatible JARs can be found in the `libs/` directory
of the project, though you are welcome to try newer ones, or
ones that you have patched yourself.

This project should work on API Level 7 and higher, except for any portions that
may be noted otherwise in this document. Please report bugs if you find features
that do not work on API Level 7 and are not noted as requiring a higher version.

Version
-------
This is version v0.1 of this module, meaning it is brand-spankin'
new.

Demo
----
In the `demo/` sub-project you will find
a sample activity that demonstrates the use of `StrictAdapter`.
